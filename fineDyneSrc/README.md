FineDyne allows users to choose a restaurant in Toronto in a holistic manner based on various constraints. Currently, it is implemented for Toronto and uses data from the Yelp dataset challenge.

It uses dc.js, dc-leaflet.js, crossfilter.dj to allow users to interact with the data and see distributions of restaurants depending on category of food, price range, and quality of restaurant.
